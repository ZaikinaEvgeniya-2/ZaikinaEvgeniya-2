Web3 represents the next iteration of the internet, leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized networks, and token-based economics to shift power from centralized entities to users.


<h2>Blockchain</h2>

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network of computers after reaching consensus using cryptography to secure the data. </br>

<b>Decentralized</b>: No single person or entity owns or controls the network.</br>
<b>Distributed</b>: Every computer (node) in the network keeps an identical copy of the ledger.</br>
<b>Immutable</b>: Once recorded, the history is "locked" and cannot be changed or deleted.</br>
<b>P2P Network</b>: The "engine" that allows computers to communicate directly without a middleman.</br>
<b>Consensus</b>: The mathematical "rulebook" nodes use to agree that a transaction is valid.</br>
<b>Cryptography</b>: The "digital lock" that secures identities and prevents anyone from tampering with the data.</br>
</br>

Any computer can become a network node by installing specific blockchain software.</br>
Once active, the node connects to the peer-to-peer network and asks other nodes for the historical record. It downloads the entire chain of data to ensure its copy is up-to-date.</br>
Once synchronized, the computer becomes a live part of the network. It now helps verify new transactions, stores a local copy of the ledger, and works with other nodes to ensure no one can change the data.</br>

There are basically two types of blockchains: public and private.

Public Blockchains: Anyone can participate in these, and they are entirely decentralized. The most popularexamples of public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum, where any individual can join the network, validate transactions, and maintain the ledger.
Private Blockchains: These are restricted to a specific group of participants and are common among businesses and organizations. Generally, private blockchains will be more centralized, with controlled access and permissions. Private blockchains for enterprises include Hyperledger and Corda.


Data is stored in groups called blocks, 
which are cryptographically linked together in chronological order, making it nearly impossible to alter or tamper with.
