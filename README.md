history of formation

  Work

 2016 year - React, Redux, StyledComponent, Bootstrap, Node JS, MongoDB
I began my career as a junior front-end developer on large internal web system for manage vehicle damages, where I worked under the guidance of manager and team lead, completing assigned tasks.
I gained experience working with version control systems such as Git, as well as project management tools like Redmine. I occasionally worked on small tasks related to the back-end of the system.
Interesting tasks

developed a customized drag-and-drop tree table with sublines and collapsible elements
designed a resizable and drag-and-drop dashboard
built a step-by-step report form using canvas to indicate damage on vehicle images.
  
  Education

^
I graduated with honors from NPI University, earning a Master of Engineering degree in Information Technology. My final job involved developing a content retrieval information system with a ranking algorithm.

^
I transferred from a regular school to a physics and mathematics lyceum with a focus on computer science to pursue my interest in information technology, and chose to take the computer science final exam.

^
During my computer science lessons, I developed a keen interest in the Pascal language and its ability to describe the steps required to achieve desired behavior using specific commands.
