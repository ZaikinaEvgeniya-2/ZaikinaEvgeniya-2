  Education

^
I graduated with honors from NPI University, earning a Master of Engineering degree in Information Technology. My final job involved developing a content retrieval information system with a ranking algorithm.

During my computer science lessons, I developed a keen interest in the Pascal language and its ability to describe the steps required to achieve desired behavior using specific commands.
